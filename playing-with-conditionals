// LEARNING ABOUT CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

let score = 100

// LOGICAL OPERATORS 

if (day === 'Payday' || happyHour === true) { 
  console.log('Drinks are on me!');
} else {
  console.log('Buy your own.');
}
// will pass either argument BTW you need to use the === sign even if using a boolean!

// TRUTHY AND FALSY ASSIGNMENT 

let garment = undefined;

// Use short circuit evaluation to assign  writingUtensil variable below:
let thingToBuy = garment || 'some clothing';

console.log(`Ah, do you want to buy ${thingToBuy}?`);

// will log 'some clothing' if the variable is null or undefined

// TERNARY OPERATORS 

let isLocked = false;

isLocked ? console.log('You will need a key to open the door.') : console.log('You will not need a key to open the door.');
// if the first argument passed after the ? is true then the first statement will pass, otherwise it will pass the statement after the colon 

let favoritePhrase = 'Love That!';

// can be used with phrases 

let salary = 34000; 

salary >= 35000 ? console.log('You need to pay more tax!') : console.log('You are on the correct tax code');  
// it works with comparison operators but remember you don't need to put the argument in brackets 

// ELSE IF STATEMENTS

// SWITCH STATEMENTS
